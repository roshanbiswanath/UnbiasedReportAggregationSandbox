            "'New Delhi, India — Addressing a rally of supporters in September 2024, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi confidently asserted that his Hindu majoritarian Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would create a new Jammu and Kashmir, “which would not only be terror-free but a heaven for tourists”. Seven months later, that promise lies in tatters. On April 22, an armed group killed 25 tourists and a local pony rider in the resort town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, setting off an escalatory spiral in tensions between India and Pakistan, which New Delhi accuses of links to the attackers – a charge Islamabad has denied. The armies of the two nuclear-armed neighbours have exchanged gunfire for three days in a row along their disputed border. India has suspended its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) that Pakistan counts on for its water security, and Islamabad has threatened to walk out of past peace deals. Both nations have also expelled each other’s diplomats, military attaches and hundreds of civilians. But India is simultaneously waging a battle on territory it controls. In Indian-administered Kashmir, security forces are blasting the homes of families of suspected armed fighters. They have raided the homes of hundreds of suspected rebel supporters and arrested more than 1,500 Kashmiris since the Pahalgam killings, the deadliest attack on tourists in a quarter of a century. Yet, as Indian forces comb dense jungles and mountains to try to capture the attackers who are still free, international relations experts and Kashmir observers say the past week has revealed major chinks in Modi’s Kashmir policy, which they say appears to be staring at a dead end. The Pahalgam attack “punctured the balloon of the ‘New Kashmir’ narrative”, said Sumantra Bose, a political scientist whose work focuses on the intersection of nationalism and conflict in South Asia.  In August 2019, the Modi government withdrew the semi-autonomous status of Indian-administered Kashmir without consultation with either the political opposition or Kashmiris. That special status had been a critical condition for Kashmir to join India following independence from the British in 1947. The Modi government argued that successive governments had failed to truly integrate Jammu and Kashmir with the rest of India, and that the semi-autonomous status had played into the hands of secessionist forces that seek to break the region from India. The abrogation of the constitutional provision that gave Kashmir its special status was accompanied by a major crackdown. Thousands of civilians were arrested, including leaders of mainstream political parties – even those that view Kashmir as a part of India. Phone and internet connections were shut off for months. Kashmir was cut off from the rest of the world. \\t\\t  \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Yet, the Modi government argued that the pain was temporary and needed to restore Kashmir to what multiple officials described as a state of “normalcy”. Since then, the arrests of civilians, including journalists, have continued. Borders of electoral constituencies were changed in a manner that saw Jammu, the Hindu-majority part of Jammu and Kashmir, gain greater political influence than the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley. Non-Kashmiris have been issued residency cards – which was not allowed before 2019 – to settle there, sparking fears that the Modi government might be attempting to change the region’s demography. And though the region held the first election to its provincial legislature in a decade in late 2024, the newly elected government of Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has been denied many of the powers other regional governments enjoy – with New Delhi, instead,  making key decisions. Amid all of that, the Modi government pushed tourism in Kashmir, pointing to a surge in visitors as evidence of the supposed normalcy that had returned to the return after four decades of armed resistance to Indian rule. In 2024, 3.5 million tourists visited Kashmir, comfortably the largest number in a decade, according to government figures. But long before the Pahalgam attack, in May 2024, Abdullah – now, the chief minister of the region, then an opposition leader – had cautioned against suggesting that tourism numbers were reflective of peace and stability in Kashmir. “The situation [in Kashmir] is not normal and talk less about tourism being an indicator of normalcy; when they link normalcy with tourism, they put tourists in danger,” Abdullah said in May last year. “You are making the tourists a target.” Al Jazeera reached out to Abdullah for a comment on the current crisis but has yet to receive a response. On April 22, that Modi government narrative that Abdullah had warned about was precisely what left the meadows of Pahalgam splattered in blood, said Praveen Donthi, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group. “New Delhi and its security agencies started buying their own assessment of peace and stability, and they became complacent, assuming that the militants will never attack tourists,” he said. Until the Pahalgam attack, armed fighters had largely spared tourists in Kashmir, keeping in mind their importance to the region’s economy, noted Donthi. “But if pushed to the wall, all it takes is two men with guns to prove that Kashmir is not normal,” he said. On April 8, just two weeks before the attack, Indian Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah, who is widely seen as Modi’s deputy, was in Srinagar, Kashmir’s largest city, to chair a security review meeting. Abdullah, the chief minister, was not a part of the meeting – the most recent instance where he has been kept out of security reviews. Analysts say this underscores that the Modi government views Kashmir’s security challenges almost exclusively as an extension of its foreign policy tensions with Pakistan, not as an issue that might also need domestic input for New Delhi to tackle it successfully. India has long accused Pakistan of arming, training and financing the armed rebellion against its government in Indian-administered Kashmir. Pakistan claims it only offers moral and diplomatic support to the secessionist movement. The Pahalgam attack has shone a light on the folly of the Modi administration’s approach, Donthi said. “Projecting this as a security crisis that is being fuelled entirely by Pakistan can make it useful politically, domestically, but it’s not going to help you resolve the conflict,” he said. “Unless the Indian government starts engaging with the Kashmiris, there can never be a durable solution to this violence.” So far, though, there is little evidence that the Modi government is contemplating a shift in approach, which appears shaped “to cater to domestic jingoism and hyper-nationalist rhetoric”, Sheikh Showkat, a Kashmir-based political commentator, said. The focus since the Pahalgam attack has been to punish Pakistan. Since 1960, the IWT – the water-sharing agreement between India and Pakistan – survived three wars and has been widely hailed as an example of managing transnational waters. Under the treaty, both countries get water from three rivers each, from the Indus Basin: three eastern rivers – the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej – to India, while three western rivers – the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab – carry 80 percent of water to Pakistan. But the future of that pact is uncertain with India suspending its participation in the treaty after the Pahalgam attack. Pakistan has responded by warning that attempts to stop or divert water resources would amount to “an act of war”. Islamabad has also warned that it might suspend its participation in all bilateral treaties, including the 1972 Simla Agreement, signed after their 1971 war, which in essence demarcates the Line of Control, the de-facto border, between them.  “Pakistan genuinely views this matter [the loss of water] in existential and even apocalyptic terms,” said Bose, the political scientist. “India knows this – and it signals a policy of collective punishment towards Pakistan, which impacts tens of millions of people.” However, experts have raised several questions about India’s and Pakistan’s announcements. How can India practically stop water when it does not have the capacity to hold these powerful rivers? Can it divert water, risking flooding in its own territory? And if Pakistan walks away from the Simla Agreement, is it in effect signalling a state of war? “All of these measures are juvenile, on both sides,” said Bose, but with “concrete implications”. For its part, India has been seeking to renegotiate the IWT for several years, claiming that it does not get its fair share of the water. “The recent Kashmir crisis gives [New] Delhi an opportunity, a pretext to pull the trigger on the treaty,” said Showkat, the Kashmiri-based commentator. Two days after the Pahalgam attack, Modi was touring Bihar, the eastern state due for elections later this year. Addressing an election rally, the prime minister said that he would chase the attackers “to the end of the earth”. To Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a Modi biographer, such speeches are reflective of what he argues is the sole objective of Modi’s Kashmir policy: “maximising the core electoral constituency of the BJP in the rest of the country by being tough on Kashmir”. Since independence, the BJP’s ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, has viewed Kashmir as an unfinished project: The RSS for decades called for the region’s special status to be scrapped, and for a firm security-driven approach to the Muslim-majority region. “Now, the only thing is, ‘We want revenge’,” said Mukhopadhyay, referring to the jingoism that currently dominates in India. Since the attack, several Kashmiris have been beaten up across India, with landlords pushing out tenants and doctors turning away Muslim patients. Social media platforms are rife with inflammatory content targeting Muslims. The International Crisis Group’s Donthi said that the Pahalgam attack, in some ways, serves as “a shot in the arm” for Modi’s government. While the security challenges in Kashmir and the crisis with Pakistan represent strategic and geopolitical tests, “domestically, it is a great position for the Modi government to be in”. He said this was especially so with a weak opposition largely falling in line – the principal opposition Congress party has backed a muscular response to Pakistan for the attack. However, Bose, the political scientist, argues that the Modi government was not focused on short-term political calculations. Modi’s comments in Bihar, and the largely unchecked hate against Kashmiris and Muslims spreading across Indian social platforms and on TV channels, were reflective of the BJP’s broader worldview on Kashmir, he said. Kashmir is an ideological battle for Modi’s party, he said, adding, “This government is never going to change its Kashmir policy.”'",
            "Just weeks ago, Nagpur was up in flames as Islamist mobs unleashed coordinated violence, targeting Hindu-owned shops, torching vehicles, and pelting stones at Hindu homes. Their provocation? A peaceful demand by Hindu advocacy groups to remove a tomb glorifying Aurangzeb, the Mughal tyrant notorious for temple destruction, forced conversions, and his brutal oppression of Hindus.\n\nThat ideological legacy came full circle on April 22 in Pahalgam, Kashmir. Islamic terrorists ambushed a group of unarmed tourists. According to eyewitnesses, the assailants checked IDs, pulled down pants to verify religion, and executed those identified as non-Muslims, point-blank.\n\nThis wasn’t an act of random violence. It was a ritual of hate— intentional, practised, scripturally sanctioned, and rooted in a centuries-old mindset that sees Hindus not as fellow citizens, but as targets in an interminable jihad to bring the whole of India under the fold of Islam.\n\nIt is important to bear in mind that what happened in Pahalgam wasn’t just a terror attack. It was a civilisational flashpoint that emerges now and then, reinforcing a centuries-old mindset that many believed died with tyrants like Aurangzeb and Alauddin Khilji, and even Bakhtiyar Khilji, the madman responsible for the annihilation of the Nalanda University. But which keeps rearing its ugly head as witnessed in protests around the country in support of Muslim invaders venerated as religious warriors who made significant contributions to spreading Islam. \n\nTo understand the horror of Pahalgam, we must revisit the ideological ancestors of such savagery. Aurangzeb wasn’t just a Mughal emperor—he was the face of brutal Islamic imperialism in India. His reign saw the destruction of temples, forced conversions, and jizya—a tax imposed on non-Muslims simply for existing.\n\nAlauddin Khilji is similarly whitewashed in some history books as a military genius and an administrator par excellence. But behind that façade was a tyrant who enslaved Hindu women and children, treating them as war booty. These men didn’t just conquer—they dehumanised. They saw Hindus not just as rivals, but as enemies of the faith, fit only for subjugation or extinction.\n\nThe never-ending jihad\n\nFast forward to 2025, and that mindset is far from extinct. It thrives among a radicalised fringe that sees itself as completing Aurangzeb’s unfinished war. In Pahalgam, terrorists reportedly checked ID cards and forced victims to strip to identify Hindus. This wasn’t random cruelty; it was ideological warfare, with roots in a medieval mindset.\n\nThese are not just men with guns. They’re warriors of an ideological jihad bent on finishing the “unfinished business.” And they are not just limited to Kashmir. They are ubiquitous, as evidenced in the recent targeted killings of Hindus in West Bengal, to the riots that swept Nagpur last month. To them, every Hindu temple that still stands is a reminder of defeat. Every festival is an insult to their supremacist fantasy. Killing a Hindu isn’t murder—it’s “divine justice.”\n\nAurangzeb’s ideological and religious descendants\n\nAurangzeb is still celebrated in parts of the Islamic world and even in Indian academia, under the banner of “nuanced history.” His atrocities are downplayed, while his “administrative genius” is bizarrely praised, much like how Hitler’s punctual trains don’t excuse the Holocaust.\n\nThe terrorists in Pahalgam made no effort to hide their inspiration. They were simply following what the Mughal tyrant did centuries ago, and which is still revered by a section of society, legitimised by the leftwing intelligentsia by summoning tropes such as “Freedom of Speech” and “right to practice one’s religion”. Destruction of idolators drove the religious fanaticism of Aurangzeb and Muslim invaders who became before him. That same religious zealotry powered the cowardly attack witnessed in Pahalgam. This isn’t fringe thinking—it’s foundational to many Islamist outfits, both across the border and disturbingly, within.\n\nWhy are Hindus targeted?\n\nThe targeting of Hindus is not accidental—it’s central to the agenda. Hindus are seen as idolaters, as resisters to a millennium of conquest. They rebuilt what was razed, revived what was outlawed. Their refusal to kneel is what earns them the sword.\n\nIn Pahalgam, this manifested again, just as it did during the 1990 Kashmiri Pandit exodus. History doesn’t whisper in India; it screams. And unless confronted, it repeats.\n\nPolitical correctness and perverse commitment to “secularism” empowering terror\n\nMainstream narratives often chant: terrorism has no religion. But Pahalgam was drenched in religious motive. From selective targeting to execution chants—this was jihad, plain and simple. Yet if you call it that, you’re labelled “communal.”\n\nThis moral cowardice is not just dishonest—it’s dangerous. It assures the jihadist that no matter how barbaric his act, society will rush to excuse it. That his victims will be forgotten, while he’ll be explained as a victim of poverty or “misunderstood” theology.\n\nA civilisation under threat: Temples looted, idols desecrated, women taken as war booty\n\nThis isn’t just about lives lost—it’s about a civilisation under assault. Islamist invaders didn’t just loot—they desecrated. Temples were torn down, not just for gold, but to send a message: your gods are dead, your culture is dust. From Somnath in the west to Qutub Minar in Delhi, which was once a magnificent home to over 27 Jain and Hindu Temples, to the sprawling Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, every Hindu foundational pillar suffered the wrath of Islamic fanaticism.\n\nEven today, mosques stand atop razed temples. This isn’t religion vs religion—it’s about whether a native civilisation is allowed to survive.\n\nHinduism and other Vedic faiths have never been expansionist. They don’t seek conversions. For thousands of years, people belonging to different Vedic faiths lived in relative harmony across the vast expanse of India. While pacifism was a hallmark of these faiths and a secret to their economic success, the recent spate of events shows it can no longer remain passive. Pahalgam is a warning: resistance is no longer optional.\n\nDemanding the removal of remnants dedicated to religious zealots isn’t hate, it is resistance\n\nCalling out this ideology isn’t Islamophobia—it’s civilizational self-respect. Wanting to survive is not extremism. Defending temples, remembering martyrs, and safeguarding traditions is not fascism. The real fascists are the ones demanding submission, wielding dogma, and justifying murder.\n\nHindus must no longer fear being called names for defending themselves. This isn’t revenge—it’s resistance. Resistance rooted in memory, truth, and unapologetic pride.\n\nIndia can no longer afford polite silence. Hollow condemnations and candlelight vigils won’t cut it. We need hard policy changes—tougher anti-terror laws, swifter justice, and zero tolerance for ideological denial.\n\nThe media must stop glorifying monsters. Academia must stop sanitising genocidal emperors. And civil society must stop equating victims with their killers.\n\nFrom Ghazni to Aurangzeb to Pahalgam: The scriptural hatred that glues the intergenerational bigotry\n\nPahalgam wasn’t an isolated incident. It was part of a civilizational war that began with Ghazni, Khilji, and Aurangzeb, and seeks revival today. During his reign, Aurangzeb similarly slaughtered Hindus with abandon. Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj was brutally tortured before being killed by Aurangzeb. Sikh Guru Tegh Bahadur was also brazenly executed on the orders of Aurangzeb for his refusal to embrace Islam. These are but an indicative list of the brutality perpetrated by Aurangzeb and the ideology he represented.\n\nHowever, instead of condemning Aurangzeb, just weeks ago in Nagpur, Islamists attacked Hindus for opposing a shrine dedicated to Aurangzeb. This is the same ideology, wearing new clothes.\n\nBut India is not weak. Hindus are not helpless. The same civilisation that withstood Khilji, Babur, and Aurangzeb will endure again. But survival is not enough. The time has come not just to remember, but to resist.\n\nSo that never again will someone have to prove their religion at gunpoint. That’s not hate. That’s resistance. That’s what learning from history means.\n\nIn this sense, there is little difference between terrorists who killed tourists after identifying them as Hindus and stone pelters who take to the streets to attack Hindu commercial establishments and public property when an honest reckoning of the Mughal emperor’s religiously motivated crimes is demanded. It is essentially the same ideology that underpins the terrorists and the stone pelters: a deep veneration for medieval-era bigots like Aurangzeb and a strong yearning to follow in their footsteps. It is just a matter of time before the so-called “innocuous” stone-pelters graduate to become Kalashnikov-wielding terrorists, wantonly killing Hindus in their perverse desire to ape their idols. In fact, in Kashmir, one cannot be sure whether a part-time stone-pelter is a full-time terrorist.\n\nSo when Hindus call for the removal of Aurangzeb’s tomb, it isn’t just about erasing the remnants of a tyrant who inflicted unspeakable torment on their ancestors. It’s about dismantling a symbol—a rallying point—for those who still revere him as a warrior of Islam and seek to walk the same blood-soaked path. It’s about cutting off the ideological oxygen that fuels modern-day jihad.\n\nThe West never built a tomb for Hitler—for good reason. They knew that even stones can be turned into shrines, and shrines can breed fanatics. India must learn the same lesson. As long as we continue to tolerate monuments that glorify the tormentors of our past, we will continue to bleed—whether in Nagpur, in Pahalgam, or wherever the next “Aurangzeb ki aulaad” decides to strike.",
            "India’s Supreme Court has awarded Hindus control of a disputed religious site in the town of Ayodhya for the construction of a temple, in a landmark verdict announced amid heightened security across the country.\nMuslims will be given five acres of land at an alternative site in Ayodhya, in northern Uttar Pradesh state, the top court ruled on Saturday.\nIn a unanimous decision over the site claimed by both Hindus and Muslims, the five-judge bench asked the government to set up a trust that will construct a temple for Hindu deity Ram.\n“The judgement is not satisfactory but we respect it. We will have discussions and then decide further course of action,” Zafaryab Jilani, Sunni Waqf Board lawyer, was quoted as saying by NDTV news channel.\nFaizan Mustafa, vice-chancellor of NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad, termed the verdict “controversial”.\n“The judges tried their best to have a kind of a balance but ultimately it’s the mystery of the faith over rule of law, because they [judges] said that we can’t be doing anything about the Hindu belief and if they believe that Ram was born here … we have to accept it,” he said.\n“Belief is good for the purposes of religion, but can it become a basis to resolve property disputes?”\nAl Jazeera’s Anchal Vohra, reporting from New Delhi, said a board of trustees [appointed by the government] would be formed in three months to essentially decide how to go about the construction of the temple.\nShe added the alternative site for Muslims would be decided by the central government or the state government.\n“Muslim intellectuals had already offered this when the mediations took place early this year as a possible solution to have broader peace between the two communities,” Vohra said.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the verdict, saying it had “amicably” ended the decades-old dispute.\n“The halls of justice have amicably concluded a matter going on for decades. Every side, every point of view was given adequate time and opportunity to express differing points of view. This verdict will further increase people’s faith in judicial processes,” Modi tweeted.\nHardliners among India’s majority Hindus, including supporters of Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), believe that Lord Ram, the warrior god, was born at the site where the Babri mosque existed. They say that the first Mughal emperor Babur built Babri Mosque on top of a temple at the site.\nMuslims said they prayed at the mosque for generations until 1949, when Hindu activists placed idols of Ram.\nThe 460-year-old mosque was demolished in 1992 by Hindu mobs triggering nationwide religious violence that left about 2,000 people dead, most of them Muslims.\nMuslim-majority Pakistan, India’s rival neighbour, responded to the decision on Saturday.\n“This decision has shredded the veneer of so-called secularism of India by making clear that minorities in India are no longer safe; they have to fear for their beliefs and for their places of worship,” the foreign office in Islamabad said in a statement. \n“The Indian government should ensure the protection of Muslims, their lives, rights and properties and avoid being yet again a silent spectator of Muslims becoming the victims of Hindu extremists and zealots.\n“The international community, the United Nations and other human rights organisations in particular should play their role by restraining India from its pursuit of an extremist ideology.”\nThe streets of Ayodhya wore a deserted look with very few businesses operating.\nAt some places, people were seen raising slogans of Jai Shree Ram (Hail Lord Ram) and congratulating each other.\nMost Hindus celebrated the court’s decision while Muslims hoped that Ayodhya would remain peaceful. In 1992, dozens of Ayodhya Muslims were killed in the wake of violence.\n“The Hindus of India have for so long wanted a temple at the place where Ram was born,” Rajesh Kumar said.\n\n\t\t\t\tDecember 6, 1992 and November 9, 2019, will be remembered as days of death of secularism in India.\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tby Nabiya Khan, a student\t\t\t\nPappu Singh, of the neighbouring state of Bihar, said the verdict was a victory for the entire nation.\n“I have been waiting for this moment for several years. Finally, the courts have heard my plea and this nothing less than a miracle.\n“With this verdict, the court has given a new life to Ram. The court has ensured that both the parties got something.\nMuslims in the Hindu holy town, however, expressed disappointment at the verdict.\n“The court has not specified where it would give the land for the mosque. If the court would have specified it, Muslims would have been pleased,” said Mohammed Shibu Khan from the Syed Bada area of Ayodhya.\n“However, I am happy that this has come to an end as the people of Ayodhya are tired of frequent shutdowns throughout the year.”\nIn the Muslim-majority area of Jamia Nagar in the capital New Delhi, people said they did not get justice.\n“[That] the Hindu mob which demolished Babri Masjid went unpunished only proves India’s incompetence as a democracy,” Nabiya Khan, a student, told Al Jazeera.\n“December 6, 1992 and November 9, 2019, will be remembered as days of death of secularism in India.”\nMohammad Mussa, 58, of Zakir Nagar, said the mosque on the site belonged to Muslims.\n“Whatever the judgement is, we should accept it because we live in an India run by the right-wing BJP which thinks this country belongs to Hindus only. Muslims should stay calm and not react to anything because there are forces who want bloodshed in the country.”\nThe Supreme Court on Saturday said a structure existed under the Babri Mosque, which was not built on vacant land.\nA 2010 lower court ruling had divided the disputed 2.77 acres (1.12 hectares) into three equal parts, with two-thirds going to the Hindu community and one-third to Muslims. That order was challenged by both sides.\nThe five-judge bench, headed by the Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, opted to hand over the site to one of the Hindu groups that had staked a claim to it.\n\n\t\t\t\tI have been waiting for this moment for several years. Finally, the courts have heard my plea and this nothing less than a miracle.\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tby Pappu Singh, Ayodhya\t\t\t\nAfter Saturday’s verdict, Modi called for calm and police went on alert, with thousands of extra personnel deployed and schools closed in and around Ayodhya, the centre of the bitter dispute, and elsewhere.\nIn some towns, internet services were also suspended to stop the spread of rumours.\nMuslim organisations have appealed for calm to prevent communal flare-ups.\nThe BJP has campaigned for years for a temple to be built at Ayodhya, and a verdict clearing the way for that is a major victory for 69-year-old Modi, just months into his second term.\nThe verdict, it is hoped, will put an end to an angry and at times arcane legal wrangle that British colonial rulers and even the Dalai Lama tried to mediate.\nAdditional reporting by Bilal Kuchay from New Delhi and Akash Bisht from Ayodhya",
            "The five-judge SC bench headed bu CJI SA Bobde has dismissed all petitions seeking review of Ayodhya verdict of November 9, which in a landmark decision handed over the entire disputed land to Ram Lalla, the deity, for a Ram temple to be built at the site.\n\n\nThe Supreme Court which today conducted an in-chamber hearing of a bunch of review petitions filed against the Ayodhya ruling rejected them after finding no merits.\n\nA 5-judge bench, headed by the then CJI Gogoi, had in a unanimous verdict on November 9 decreed the entire 2.77 acres disputed land in favour of deity ‘Ram Lalla’ and also directed the Centre to allot a five-acre plot to Sunni Waqf Board for building a mosque in Ayodhya.\n\nRead: Allah’s law above all: Jamia Millia students group plans event calling Ayodhya verdict a farce, Ramrajya ‘oppressive’\n\nEighteen review petitions have so far been filed in the apex court against the November 9 decision, of which eight were filed by those who were parties in the Ayodhya land title dispute and rest by third parties who were not directly involved in the decade-old legal battle.\n\nThe review petitions have been filed by Mufti Hasbullah, Moulana Mahfoozur Rehman, Mohammad Umar, Haji Mehboob, Misbahuddin, Haji Asad Ahmed, Shia Central Board of Waqfs and Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha who were litigants in the title suit.
